# gt-itemsdat-json
Python 3.11 tool to convert/parse Growtopia's items.dat file into a JSON format.

## Usage
Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed. Run `python itemsdat-json <path to items.dat>`. You might want to redirect the output to a file via shell capabilities.

If something doesn't work, it's likely this parser is out of date, in which case you might want to edit the `template.py` file. The `itemsdat-info` script might also help with figuring out what changes the new version brings.
